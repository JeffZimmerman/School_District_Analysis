# School_District_Analysis: Using Python and Jupyter Notebook to Analyze School District Data

## Overview
This project draws on academic data taken from a sample school district in order to better organize it for identifying key information and evaluating patterns. On being alerted to suspicions of academic dishonesty, the analysis focuses on reading and math scores for Thomas High School ninth graders, while keeping the rest of the data intact. By replacing the suspected scores with NaN values, the aim is to explore how this change affects the overall scores for the district.
